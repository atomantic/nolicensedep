# No License

> An Art Project that Questions the Nature of Open Source Licensing Chains

# About

You may note that this module has no explicit OSS license.

It is published on github.com, which notes that projects are under no obligation to choose a license. Projects without explicit licenses fall under default copyright law, which assigns all rights to the creator at the time of creation and disallows reproduction, distribution, derivatives, or use without permission: [github licensing docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository)

This code repository is published by the author on npmjs.com where it might be picked up by other projects. Please note in the npmjs.com docs that publishers of content on NPM lose no rights to arbitrary or non-explicit licensing when publishing code (aside from allowing NPM to copy, publish, and analyze the content and to share analysis with others): https://docs.npmjs.com/policies/open-source-terms#your-content

# Why

This project appeared in the authors mind as a reaction to this thread: https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/issues/2059

and a subsequent attempt to correct some of the issues plaguing the open source world:

https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/pull/4222

Projects sometimes have massive networks of dependencies. A top-level project license often times has an "as-is" clause and a limitation or waiver of liability by the top level project author. In theory, these waivers pass the liability of copyright violation all the way to an end user, even though a sub-project might be hidden an arbitrary number of layers down from the top-level project source.

This project has no dependencies... but will it have no parents?
